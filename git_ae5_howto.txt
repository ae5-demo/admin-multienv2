- AE5 uses git backend gitea by default, but can be configured with github, bitbucket and gitlab
- every session is a new branch with <username>-<sessionid> and it is stored in $TOOL_PROJECT_BRANCH
- if using external git, the credentials are stored in /var/run/credentials/<someid>
- the following will configure your git remote with your credentials so you can push from commandline
```[[ $(command -v jq ]] && conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge jq                # make sure we have JQ
   TMP=$(find /var/run/secrets/credentials/ -type f | xargs jq -r '"https://\(.username):\(.token)"') # get user/pass from secretes - need to make sure that this is only for the git... 
   git remote set-url origin https://TMP@$(git config -l | grep -Po "remote.origin.url=https://\K(.*)")
   unset TMP
  
 ```
